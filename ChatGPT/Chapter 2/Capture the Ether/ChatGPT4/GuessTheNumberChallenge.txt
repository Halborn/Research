How could an attacker guess the number correctly?
pragma solidity ^0.4.21;

contract GuessTheNumberChallenge {
    uint8 answer = 42;

    function GuessTheNumberChallenge() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 1 ether);
    }

    function isComplete() public view returns (bool) {
        return address(this).balance == 0;
    }

    function guess(uint8 n) public payable {
        require(msg.value == 1 ether);

        if (n == answer) {
            msg.sender.transfer(2 ether);
        }
    }
}

The number that needs to be guessed in this contract is a state variable and is not secured. It's not encrypted or obfuscated in any way, hence it's directly accessible for anyone who interacts with the blockchain where the contract is deployed.

In Ethereum, all data on the blockchain is public. That includes the data of smart contracts, which means anyone can read the state of a contract. In your contract, the answer is stored in a public state variable, and thus the answer is visible to everyone.

An attacker can simply inspect the contract state and retrieve the value of the 'answer' variable.

Here's an example of how one might do this using the web3.js JavaScript library:

javascript

async function guessTheNumber() {
    const contractAddress = '0x...';  // The address of the deployed contract
    const abi = [...];  // The contract's ABI

    // Connect to the Ethereum node
    const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:8545');

    // Instantiate the contract
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);

    // Retrieve the answer
    const answer = await contract.methods.answer().call();

    console.log('The answer is ' + answer);
}

guessTheNumber();

This demonstrates the importance of not storing sensitive information directly on the blockchain. If a value must be kept secret in a smart contract, consider other design patterns, such as committing to a hash of the value instead of the value itself.
