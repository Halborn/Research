How could someone became the owner?
pragma solidity ^0.4.21;

contract AssumeOwnershipChallenge {
    address owner;
    bool public isComplete;

    function AssumeOwmershipChallenge() public {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function authenticate() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner);

        isComplete = true;
    }
}

This contract appears to have a constructor with a typo in its name, which is a common security vulnerability in Solidity. The correct name for the constructor should be AssumeOwnershipChallenge, which matches the contract name. However, due to the typo, AssumeOwmershipChallenge does not behave as a constructor.

In Solidity, constructors are special functions that are executed at contract creation time and cannot be executed afterwards. However, if the function does not correctly match the contract name (due to a typo or the contract name being changed later), then this function becomes a normal function that can be called anytime, not just at contract creation.

So in this contract, the AssumeOwmershipChallenge function which is meant to be a constructor, sets the contract owner to the address that deploys the contract (as msg.sender is the address deploying the contract). Due to the typo, it's not a constructor but a regular function.

This means that anyone can call this AssumeOwmershipChallenge function and change the owner to their own address (msg.sender) at any time.

Once someone does this, they become the owner of the contract and can call the authenticate function to set isComplete to true.

So to become the owner, all one has to do is interact with the contract and call the AssumeOwmershipChallenge function, which sets owner to their address (msg.sender). After doing this, they will be the owner and will be able to successfully call the authenticate function.
