To become the owner of an already deployed smart contract, you will need to know the address of the deployed contract and the private key associated with the address that was used to deploy the contract.

Assuming you have both the address and the private key, you can interact with the contract using a tool such as Remix or MyEtherWallet to call the contribute() function with a contribution greater than the current owner's contribution, which will update the owner to be the address that called the function.

Alternatively, if the contract has a fallback function (as is the case in the example code you provided), you could send a transaction to the contract with a value greater than zero and with an address that has previously made a contribution to the contract. This will also update the owner to be the address that sent the transaction.

It's important to note that changing the owner of a contract in this way may not be allowed by the original contract creator and may even be prohibited by the contract's logic. Additionally, changing the owner of a contract can have significant implications for the contract's functionality and security, so it's important to understand the implications of such a change before proceeding.

Once I am the owner how can I withdraw the funds?

As the owner of the contract, you can withdraw the funds by calling the withdraw() function. This function will transfer the balance of the contract to the owner's address.

To do this, you can interact with the contract using a tool such as Remix or MyEtherWallet and call the withdraw() function while logged in as the contract owner. If successful, the funds will be transferred from the contract to the owner's account.

It's worth noting that the withdraw() function includes the onlyOwner modifier, which means that only the contract owner can call this function. If you try to call this function from an address that is not the owner, the transaction will fail.
