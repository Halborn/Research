Given the code provided and the constraints specified, you want to make the Motorbike's engine unusable or inoperative. From the smart contract perspective, this could mean modifying its state so that it's no longer functional. However, with the constraints given (i.e., the contracts are already deployed and can't be modified), it's not directly possible to self-destruct the Engine or Motorbike contract because they don't have a self-destruct mechanism built into them.

However, there is a way you could make the Motorbike's engine "unusable" if you have the authority to upgrade the contract, i.e., if you're the upgrader specified in the Engine contract.

The UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern allows you to replace the current contract logic with new contract logic. Given that you're using UUPS, you could deploy a new contract with the same interface as Engine but where all the functions are disabled or throw errors, and then upgrade the Engine contract to the new contract.

This would effectively render the Motorbike inoperative, at least until the Engine is upgraded again with a functioning implementation.

Here's an example of a "broken" engine:

solidity

contract BrokenEngine is Initializable {
    function initialize() external initializer {
        revert("Engine has been destroyed");
    }
}

If you were to set this as the new implementation of the proxy, any attempts to interact with the Engine (or Motorbike in this case) would result in a "Engine has been destroyed" error, effectively rendering it inoperative.

Just bear in mind that this approach would still require the upgrader role, and would not completely destroy the contracts. Rather, it would simply make them unusable until a functioning implementation is provided.

Also, note that depending on the context and the specific functionalities of your contracts, there may be other specific ways to render the Motorbike inoperative. For example, if the Motorbike contract had specific functions controlling the operation of the bike that could be disabled or misconfigured, those might provide another route to achieving your goal.

hoe could an attacker become the upgrader?
ChatGPT


If the contracts are written and deployed securely, an attacker should not be able to gain the upgrader role. The role is explicitly set to the address that deploys the Engine contract in the initialize function and there's no functionality in the given contracts that allows for changing the upgrader.

However, there are situations where an attacker might gain control over the upgrader role:

    Phishing or Social Engineering Attacks: These attacks involve tricking the upgrader into revealing their private key or tricking them into transferring the role to the attacker.

    Private Key Theft: If the upgrader's private key is not stored securely and is stolen, the attacker could assume the upgrader role.

    Poorly Written Contracts: If a contract has a function that allows for changing the upgrader without the proper security checks, an attacker could exploit this to become the upgrader.

    Reentrancy Attacks: If the contract contains a function that makes an external call to another contract before it resolves its internal state (for example, it sends Ether before subtracting the sent amount from the sender's balance), an attacker might be able to create a malicious contract that recursively calls back into the original contract, altering its state.

    Front-Running: If an action on the blockchain (like changing the upgrader) is predictable and not protected against frontrunning, an attacker can watch the transaction pool and try to get their transaction mined before the original one. This generally requires more resources and deeper knowledge.

    Force Sending Ether to a Contract: While it wouldn't give an attacker the upgrader role, force-sending Ether to a contract can potentially put it in an unusable state if the contract isn't designed to handle this situation.

It's important to note that if smart contracts are written correctly, tested thoroughly, audited by professionals, and private keys are handled securely, the likelihood of these attacks can be greatly reduced.
User
and if the contract wasnt deployed securely?
ChatGPT
3 / 3

If the contract was not deployed securely, there could be several ways in which an attacker could gain control of the upgrader role. Here are some examples:

    Incorrectly set upgrader: If the initial upgrader was not set correctly during deployment or was set to an incorrect address, an attacker could potentially gain control if they control the incorrectly set address.

    Unprotected setter function: If there was a function that allowed changing the upgrader without proper access control measures (like onlyOwner or similar modifiers), an attacker could call this function and set themselves as the upgrader.

    Uninitialized contract: If the contract's initialize function was not called during deployment, the upgrader variable could be left unset. In this case, depending on the implementation, an attacker could potentially call the initialize function and set themselves as the upgrader.

    Re-entrancy attack: If the contract has other functions that make external calls with .call() or .delegatecall(), there could be a potential for a re-entrancy attack. This is unlikely given your provided code, but could be a possibility in a more complex implementation.

    Underflows/Overflows: Older versions of Solidity didn't automatically check for underflows and overflows. In such cases, an attacker could exploit this to manipulate the upgrader variable, although this would be very unlikely and complex in practice, especially with a variable type of address.

Remember, these vulnerabilities would be considered major flaws in a contract. It's extremely important to properly secure contracts, use good development practices (like using OpenZeppelin's contracts library which has been thoroughly reviewed and tested), and to conduct thorough security audits before deploying any smart contract.
User

can you explain this a little bit?
Uninitialized contract: If the contract's initialize function was not called during deployment, the upgrader variable could be left unset. In this case, depending on the implementation, an attacker could potentially call the initialize function and set themselves as the upgrader.
ChatGPT


Sure, I'd be happy to explain further.

In the context of upgradeable contracts, the constructor function is typically not used. This is because the constructor is only called when a contract is first deployed, but not when it's upgraded to a new implementation. To ensure that initialization logic runs for each new implementation, an initialize function is often used instead.

However, unlike a constructor, the initialize function is not automatically called when the contract is deployed or upgraded to. It needs to be manually called by someone, typically right after deployment or upgrade.

If the initialize function is not called, the state variables of the contract are not set. For the Engine contract you provided, this means the upgrader and horsePower would not be set.

An attacker could exploit this by calling the initialize function themselves. This would set upgrader to their address (the address that sent the transaction), giving them control over the Engine contract.

This kind of issue can be mitigated by using an initializer modifier from OpenZeppelin's Initializable contract. This ensures that initialize can only be called once, preventing an attacker from calling it after it has already been called. In the Engine contract you provided, this modifier is used, which helps to prevent this kind of attack.

However, if the contract deployer forgets to call initialize entirely, then an attacker could still potentially exploit this. This underscores the importance of ensuring that the initialize function is properly called when deploying or upgrading to a new contract implementation.
User
when calling the motorbike contract it says it is initialized, is there any other way I could call the initialize function?
ChatGPT
4 / 4

If the Motorbike contract and Engine contract are initialized properly and the upgrader role is already set, then calling the initialize function again should be protected by the initializer modifier from the Initializable contract and it should fail.

However, there's one scenario that may apply in the context of upgradeable contracts. If the Engine contract has been upgraded to a new implementation, the initializer modifier will not prevent the initialize function from being called on the new implementation. This is because each implementation has its own separate state, and the initialized state variable in the Initializable contract won't carry over from one implementation to the next.

This means if a new Engine implementation is deployed and set as the new implementation for the Motorbike contract's proxy, but the initialize function is not called for the new implementation, then someone could potentially call initialize on the new implementation and set themselves as the upgrader.

This scenario is dependent on a mistake being made during the upgrade process - forgetting to call initialize on the new implementation. As such, it's important to have a robust upgrade process and to thoroughly test and audit contracts and their upgrade procedures.

If all procedures are followed correctly, and the upgrader role is properly protected and managed, then it shouldn't be possible for an unauthorized party to call initialize and set themselves as the upgrader.
User

how would I know if Ithe Motorbike contract and Engine contract are initialized properly ?
ChatGPT

There are a few ways you can verify if the Motorbike contract and Engine contract are initialized properly:

    Check Contract State Variables: You can verify the initialization by checking the state variables in the contract. For the Engine contract you provided, this would involve checking if the upgrader address is set to a valid, known address and if horsePower is set to an expected value. Similarly, for the Motorbike contract, you could check if the _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT is set to a valid, known contract address. This can be done via a Web3 library (like web3.js or ethers.js) or a blockchain explorer that allows for reading contract state variables (like Etherscan).

    Transaction Logs: If you have access to the transaction hashes that were used to deploy and initialize the contracts, you could check these transactions' logs on a blockchain explorer like Etherscan. Successful execution of the initialize function would be logged in the transaction's event logs.

    Interaction: Try interacting with the contract. If the contract was not initialized, the functions may not behave as expected. For example, if horsePower was not set in the Engine contract, then any function that uses horsePower might revert or return an unexpected value.

    Check with Contract Owner/Creator: If you are not the person who deployed the contract, you can always ask the contract owner or creator to confirm if they have correctly initialized the contract.

Remember, these are ways to verify the initialization of these specific contracts (Motorbike and Engine). Other contracts might require different checks depending on their logic and the state variables they use.
User
can you provide some code in python that check Contract State Variables for the engine and motorbike contract?
ChatGPT

Certainly, you can use the Web3.py library to interact with Ethereum contracts. Here is a basic example of how you can check the state variables:

Before proceeding, make sure you have web3.py installed in your Python environment. If not, install it using pip:

bash

pip install web3

Here's the Python code:

python

from web3 import Web3

# Connect to Ethereum node
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('http://localhost:8545')) # Replace with your node address

# Replace with your contract addresses
motorbike_contract_address = '0xYourMotorbikeContractAddress'
engine_contract_address = '0xYourEngineContractAddress'

# Replace with your contract ABIs
motorbike_contract_abi = '[YourMotorbikeContractABI]'
engine_contract_abi = '[YourEngineContractABI]'

# Create contract instances
motorbike_contract = w3.eth.contract(address=motorbike_contract_address, abi=motorbike_contract_abi)
engine_contract = w3.eth.contract(address=engine_contract_address, abi=engine_contract_abi)

# Retrieve the state variables
engine_upgrader = engine_contract.functions.upgrader().call()
engine_horsepower = engine_contract.functions.horsePower().call()

# _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT is a constant and doesn't have a corresponding getter function in Solidity
# But we can manually calculate the storage slot according to EIP-1967 and retrieve its value
implementation_slot = Web3.solidityKeccak(['string'], ['eip1967.proxy.implementation']).hex()[:-1] + 'c'
motorbike_implementation = w3.eth.getStorageAt(motorbike_contract_address, int(implementation_slot, 16))

print(f"Engine upgrader: {engine_upgrader}")
print(f"Engine horse power: {engine_horsepower}")
print(f"Motorbike implementation address: {motorbike_implementation}")

Please replace 'http://localhost:8545' with the address of your Ethereum node (this could be a local node or a service like Infura or Alchemy), replace '0xYourMotorbikeContractAddress' and '0xYourEngineContractAddress' with your actual contract addresses, and replace '[YourMotorbikeContractABI]' and '[YourEngineContractABI]' with your actual contract ABIs.

This script will connect to your Ethereum node, interact with your contracts, and print the values of upgrader and horsePower in the Engine contract and the _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT value in the Motorbike contract.

Remember that you need to convert the retrieved _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT value from bytes to an address format.

engine_upgrader is 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, if I call initialize on the engine, should I become the upgrader?
ChatGPT

Yes, if the upgrader variable in the Engine contract is set to the zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000), it indicates that the initialize function has not been called yet.

The initialize function in the Engine contract sets the upgrader state variable to the address of the sender of the transaction (msg.sender). Therefore, if you call initialize on the Engine contract, upgrader should be set to your address, and you would have the ability to upgrade the contract's implementation.

However, it's important to remember that calling initialize would be considered an attack on the contract if you are not the intended upgrader. If this is a real contract on the Ethereum network, I would strongly advise against trying to take control of it unless you have been given explicit permission to do so. Unauthorized attempts to take control of contracts can be illegal and unethical.

If this is part of a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge or an Ethereum test network (Ropsten, Rinkeby, etc.) and you have the contract owner's permission or the task's goal is to find and exploit such vulnerabilities, then proceeding would be part of the exercise. Always ensure to act ethically and within legal bounds when interacting with smart contracts.
User
once I am the upgrader on the engine, how do I update the implementation contract on the motorbike one to one that selfdestruct? Please provide the code necessary using web3py and solicity
ChatGPT

In order to make the Motorbike contract self-destruct, you would need to upgrade it to a new implementation that contains a function that calls selfdestruct.

First, you'll need to create and deploy a new contract that includes this selfdestruct function.

Here's a simple example of such a contract in Solidity:

solidity

pragma solidity <0.7.0;

contract SelfDestructEngine {

    // The address to receive the contract's funds when selfdestruct is called.
    address payable public recipient;

    constructor(address payable _recipient) public {
        recipient = _recipient;
    }

    function destroy() external {
        selfdestruct(recipient);
    }
}

This contract has a destroy function that, when called, will selfdestruct the contract and send any remaining Ether in the contract to the recipient address.

You can deploy this contract using Remix, truffle, hardhat, or any other Ethereum development tool of your choice. Make sure to keep track of the address of the deployed SelfDestructEngine contract.

Next, you need to upgrade the Engine contract to this new SelfDestructEngine implementation using the upgradeToAndCall function. Since you are the upgrader, you can call this function.

Here's a Python script using web3.py that demonstrates how to do this:

python

from web3 import Web3

# Connect to Ethereum node
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('http://localhost:8545')) # Replace with your node address

# Replace with your contract addresses
engine_contract_address = '0xYourEngineContractAddress'
self_destruct_engine_address = '0xYourSelfDestructEngineContractAddress'

# Replace with your contract ABI
engine_contract_abi = '[YourEngineContractABI]'

# Create contract instance
engine_contract = w3.eth.contract(address=engine_contract_address, abi=engine_contract_abi)

# Replace with the address that will receive the contract's funds when selfdestruct is called
recipient_address = '0xYourRecipientAddress'

# The data for the initialize function call
# No arguments are needed for initialize in this case, so the data is just the function selector
data = '0x' + ''.join(f'{x:02x}' for x in w3.sha3(text='initialize()')[:4])

# Call upgradeToAndCall
tx_hash = engine_contract.functions.upgradeToAndCall(self_destruct_engine_address, data).transact({'from': w3.eth.defaultAccount})
receipt = w3.eth.waitForTransactionReceipt(tx_hash)

print(f'Transaction status: {receipt["status"]}')

Make sure to replace 'http://localhost:8545' with your Ethereum node address, '0xYourEngineContractAddress' with your Engine contract address, '0xYourSelfDestructEngineContractAddress' with your SelfDestructEngine contract address, '0xYourRecipientAddress' with the recipient's address that will receive the contract's funds when selfdestruct is called, and [YourEngineContractABI] with your Engine contract ABI.

After running this script, the Engine contract should be upgraded to the SelfDestructEngine contract, and you should be able to call the destroy function to selfdestruct the contract.

Remember to replace '0xYourRecipientAddress' with a valid Ethereum address where you want the funds to be sent in case there are any funds in the contract at the time of self-destruction.

Please note that this process is irreversible. Once a contract is destroyed via the selfdestruct function, it cannot be restored
User
when trying to call the upgradeToAndCall with the SelfDestructEngine address and the data 
data = '0x' + ''.join(f'{x:02x}' for x in w3.sha3(text='initialize()')[:4])
it reverts
ChatGPT

That's likely because the SelfDestructEngine contract doesn't have an initialize function, which you're trying to call with upgradeToAndCall. The data argument in upgradeToAndCall is meant to allow calling a function in the new implementation contract immediately after upgrading to it.

In the case of SelfDestructEngine, you might want to call the constructor and set the recipient address during the upgrade, but Solidity doesn't allow constructors or initialization functions to be called on already deployed contracts.

One possible solution is to modify the SelfDestructEngine contract to include an initialization function that can be called to set the recipient address. Here's how you can modify the SelfDestructEngine contract:

solidity

pragma solidity <0.7.0;

contract SelfDestructEngine {

    address payable public recipient;

    function initialize(address payable _recipient) external {
        require(recipient == address(0), "Already initialized");
        recipient = _recipient;
    }

    function destroy() external {
        selfdestruct(recipient);
    }
}

With this change, you can call initialize in SelfDestructEngine with the recipient address as argument when you call upgradeToAndCall in Engine. Here's how you can modify the Python code:

python

from web3 import Web3

# Connect to Ethereum node
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('http://localhost:8545')) # Replace with your node address

# Replace with your contract addresses
engine_contract_address = '0xYourEngineContractAddress'
self_destruct_engine_address = '0xYourSelfDestructEngineContractAddress'

# Replace with your contract ABI
engine_contract_abi = '[YourEngineContractABI]'

# Create contract instance
engine_contract = w3.eth.contract(address=engine_contract_address, abi=engine_contract_abi)

# Replace with the address that will receive the contract's funds when selfdestruct is called
recipient_address = '0xYourRecipientAddress'

# The data for the initialize function call
# This time, we include the recipient address as argument
data = engine_contract.encodeABI(fn_name='initialize', args=[recipient_address])

# Call upgradeToAndCall
tx_hash = engine_contract.functions.upgradeToAndCall(self_destruct_engine_address, data).transact({'from': w3.eth.defaultAccount})
receipt = w3.eth.waitForTransactionReceipt(tx_hash)

print(f'Transaction status: {receipt["status"]}')

Please replace 'http://localhost:8545' with your Ethereum node address, '0xYourEngineContractAddress' with your Engine contract address, '0xYourSelfDestructEngineContractAddress' with your SelfDestructEngine contract address, '0xYourRecipientAddress' with the recipient's address that will receive the contract's funds when selfdestruct is called, and [YourEngineContractABI] with your Engine contract ABI.

After running this script, the Engine contract should be upgraded to the SelfDestructEngine contract, and you should be able to call the destroy function to selfdestruct the contract.
User
it seems that still reverts when calling initialize
ChatGPT

If the transaction is still reverting when trying to call the initialize function, it might be due to one of these reasons:

    The initialize function has already been called. In the updated SelfDestructEngine contract, we have a condition that the function can only be called if the recipient address is the zero address. If the initialize function has been called already, the recipient address would be non-zero, and trying to call initialize again would revert.

    Incorrect function signature or arguments. Ensure that you are correctly encoding the function signature and arguments in the data for the upgradeToAndCall function. If you make a mistake in encoding the function signature or arguments, the call will fail.

    Not enough gas. It's also possible that the transaction is running out of gas. Try increasing the gas limit in the transaction options.

To troubleshoot the issue, you may want to check the following:

    Use a service like Etherscan to look at the transaction that is reverting. This could provide clues as to why the transaction is failing.

    Make sure the initialize function has not been called already. You can do this by checking the recipient address in the SelfDestructEngine contract. If it's not the zero address, then initialize has already been called.

    Make sure you are correctly encoding the function signature and arguments. You can check the ABI of the SelfDestructEngine contract to verify the function signature.

    Try increasing the gas limit in the transaction options.

If the issue still persists, you could modify the initialize function in SelfDestructEngine to emit an event or return a value. This would allow you to see if the function is being called and if the input arguments are correct.
User
can I avoid calling initializable?
ChatGPT

In the given contract setup, the initialize function serves the important purpose of setting up the upgrader and horsePower values for the Engine contract. However, if you are updating to a contract which does not require any initialization (like the SelfDestructEngine contract we mentioned before), you can pass an empty data parameter when calling the upgradeToAndCall function.

Here's how you can modify the Python script:

python

from web3 import Web3

# Connect to Ethereum node
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('http://localhost:8545')) # Replace with your node address

# Replace with your contract addresses
engine_contract_address = '0xYourEngineContractAddress'
self_destruct_engine_address = '0xYourSelfDestructEngineContractAddress'

# Replace with your contract ABI
engine_contract_abi = '[YourEngineContractABI]'

# Create contract instance
engine_contract = w3.eth.contract(address=engine_contract_address, abi=engine_contract_abi)

# Empty data as the new implementation does not require any initialization
data = '0x'

# Call upgradeToAndCall
tx_hash = engine_contract.functions.upgradeToAndCall(self_destruct_engine_address, data).transact({'from': w3.eth.defaultAccount})
receipt = w3.eth.waitForTransactionReceipt(tx_hash)

print(f'Transaction status: {receipt["status"]}')

This will set the Engine's implementation to be SelfDestructEngine without calling any initialization function.

Remember that you would need to have a mechanism in SelfDestructEngine to set the recipient of the selfdestruct call, or otherwise it would be an address zero, which is not what you usually want.

Given your scenario, it seems you have two layers of proxy contracts (Motorbike and Engine), and you only have the ability to upgrade the Engine contract but not the Motorbike contract. However, the Motorbike contract is the one that delegates all calls to its implementation, which is set to be the Engine contract. In the current setup, when the Engine contract is upgraded, the Motorbike contract still delegates calls to the new implementation of the Engine contract.

One thing you might attempt is to upgrade the Engine contract to a new contract that would, in its fallback function, self-destruct. This new contract would need to be carefully crafted to include a fallback function that, when called, would call selfdestruct.

Here's a simple Solidity example of such a contract:

solidity

pragma solidity <0.7.0;

contract SelfDestructEngine {
    address payable public recipient;

    constructor(address payable _recipient) public {
        recipient = _recipient;
    }

    // This fallback function will be called if no other function matches the call data
    fallback() external payable {
        selfdestruct(recipient);
    }
}

This contract would self-destruct as soon as it receives any call that doesn't match one of its defined functions.

However, this plan still has risks and caveats:

    It's important to note that self-destructing a contract is a severe action and cannot be undone. It should only be done with caution and full awareness of the consequences.

    When a contract self-destructs, it will no longer be able to receive ETH, and any ETH sent to it will be lost forever. Also, any remaining ETH in the contract will be sent to the recipient address, and this address should be carefully set to be able to receive and manage this ETH.

    This plan assumes that the proxy contract (the Motorbike contract in your case) will not have any mechanism that would prevent or revert the self-destruction of the contract. It's crucial to thoroughly review the code of the proxy contract and any other related contract to make sure they don't have any mechanism that could interfere with this plan.

    It's also assumed that you have the ability and permission to upgrade the Engine contract and that there's no other mechanism or condition that would prevent or revert this operation.

Finally, as always, keep in mind that all these operations involve risks and should be done with caution and full understanding of the Ethereum platform, the Solidity language, the specific contracts and code you're dealing with, and the overall context and implications.

The fallback function is called when a function that does not exist in the contract is called or if no data is sent with the transaction. When calling upgradeToAndCall on the Engine contract, it upgrades the implementation and then delegates a call to the new implementation with the provided data.

To trigger the fallback function of the new implementation during the upgradeToAndCall process, you can pass empty data. Here is how you can modify your Python code:

python

from web3 import Web3

# Connect to Ethereum node
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('http://localhost:8545')) # Replace with your node address

# Replace with your contract addresses
engine_contract_address = '0xYourEngineContractAddress'
self_destruct_engine_address = '0xYourSelfDestructEngineContractAddress'

# Replace with your contract ABI
engine_contract_abi = '[YourEngineContractABI]'

# Create contract instance
engine_contract = w3.eth.contract(address=engine_contract_address, abi=engine_contract_abi)

# Empty data to call the fallback function
data = '0x'

# Call upgradeToAndCall
tx_hash = engine_contract.functions.upgradeToAndCall(self_destruct_engine_address, data).transact({'from': w3.eth.defaultAccount})
receipt = w3.eth.waitForTransactionReceipt(tx_hash)

print(f'Transaction status: {receipt["status"]}')

This would set the new implementation to the SelfDestructEngine contract and immediately trigger the fallback function which calls selfdestruct.

However, as mentioned before, this is a risky operation and can have irreversible consequences. It is also crucial to thoroughly review the contracts involved and understand the full implications before attempting to self-destruct a contract.

when passing empty data it doesnt seem to be executing the fallback function. which data should i pass to trigger it?

The upgradeToAndCall function in your Engine contract attempts to perform a delegatecall to the new implementation with the provided data. If the data is empty, the function call would effectively become a no-op, as there's no function to call in the new implementation contract. It wouldn't trigger the fallback function, because delegatecall only triggers the fallback function if it's given data that doesn't match any existing function signature, not if it's given empty data.

You can craft some input data that doesn't match any function signatures in the new implementation contract to force the fallback function to trigger. However, the new implementation contract (the SelfDestructEngine contract in your case) doesn't have any other function except for the constructor and the fallback function, so you can use the function signature of any function that doesn't exist in this contract to trigger the fallback function.

Here is how you can do this with web3.py:

python

from web3 import Web3

# Connect to Ethereum node
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('http://localhost:8545')) # Replace with your node address

# Replace with your contract addresses
engine_contract_address = '0xYourEngineContractAddress'
self_destruct_engine_address = '0xYourSelfDestructEngineContractAddress'

# Replace with your contract ABI
engine_contract_abi = '[YourEngineContractABI]'

# Create contract instance
engine_contract = w3.eth.contract(address=engine_contract_address, abi=engine_contract_abi)

# Function signature of a function that doesn't exist in the new implementation contract
data = w3.toBytes(hexstr='0xdeadbeef')

# Call upgradeToAndCall
tx_hash = engine_contract.functions.upgradeToAndCall(self_destruct_engine_address, data).transact({'from': w3.eth.defaultAccount})
receipt = w3.eth.waitForTransactionReceipt(tx_hash)

print(f'Transaction status: {receipt["status"]}')

In this example, '0xdeadbeef' is the function signature of a function that doesn't exist in the SelfDestructEngine contract, so it would trigger the fallback function. Be aware that this is a random value and the actual value you should use could be different depending on your specific case and contracts. You should ensure that the chosen function signature doesn't match any existing function in your contract to make sure the fallback function is triggered.
