How can I be the owner of this contract? I can't modify the code and it is already deployed

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

import 'openzeppelin-contracts-06/math/SafeMath.sol';

contract Fallout {
  
  using SafeMath for uint256;
  mapping (address => uint) allocations;
  address payable public owner;


  /* constructor */
  function Fal1out() public payable {
    owner = msg.sender;
    allocations[owner] = msg.value;
  }

  modifier onlyOwner {
	        require(
	            msg.sender == owner,
	            "caller is not the owner"
	        );
	        _;
	    }

  function allocate() public payable {
    allocations[msg.sender] = allocations[msg.sender].add(msg.value);
  }

  function sendAllocation(address payable allocator) public {
    require(allocations[allocator] > 0);
    allocator.transfer(allocations[allocator]);
  }

  function collectAllocations() public onlyOwner {
    msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
  }

  function allocatorBalance(address allocator) public view returns (uint) {
    return allocations[allocator];
  }
}

If the contract has already been deployed and you do not have the ownership, you will not be able to modify the contract or become the owner of it. This is one of the fundamental aspects of the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts: once a contract is deployed, it is immutable. In other words, the contract cannot be changed. This includes the state variables, such as the owner variable in your contract.

Moreover, the ownership of a smart contract typically gets assigned at the time of contract deployment. In the case of the Fallout contract, the owner of the contract would be the account that called the Fal1out function. Therefore, if you were not the one who deployed the contract (i.e., called the Fal1out function), you will not be the owner.

If you want to become the owner of such a contract, you would need to deploy a new instance of the contract yourself, which will make you the owner of the new contract. If you need the state from the old contract in the new one, you would need to build a migration function in the old contract (which requires the ability to update the old contract).

If you need to take ownership of an existing contract for which you do not have the ownership, you'll have to contact the current owner and request them to transfer the ownership to you. This, of course, assumes that the contract has been designed to allow for the transfer of ownership, which the contract in your question does not support.

Lastly, you might have noticed that the constructor function is incorrectly named Fal1out, which is different from the contract's name Fallout. This is actually a common vulnerability in Solidity, often referred to as the "wrong constructor name" vulnerability. Because of the wrong name, this function can be called by anyone, not just once during deployment. Whoever calls this function will become the contract owner. Please ensure to always name the constructor function the same as the contract name or use the constructor keyword in Solidity versions 0.4.22 and later to avoid such issues.
