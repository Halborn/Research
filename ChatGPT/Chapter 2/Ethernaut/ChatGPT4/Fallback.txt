This contract is designed to change ownership based on the amount of Ether (ETH) contributed by an account. There are two primary ways to become the owner:

    By being the largest contributor: When a function contribute() is called, it accepts Ether from the sender. It checks whether the value of the sent Ether is less than 0.001 ETH. If so, it increases the sender's contribution in the contract by the amount of sent Ether. If the sender's total contribution becomes larger than the current owner's contribution, the sender becomes the new owner of the contract.

    By being the last to send Ether to the contract: If any Ether is directly sent to the contract (through a fallback function, denoted as receive()), the sender becomes the owner, provided that the sender has contributed before.

Here are the steps to become the owner:

    Contribute sufficient Ether: You need to call the contribute() function with an Ether value less than 0.001. Repeat this until your total contribution is larger than the current owner's contribution. To do this, you would use an Ethereum-compatible interface or client, like Metamask, MyEtherWallet, etc. Note that you'll also need to have ETH in your account to use as gas fees for these transactions.

    Directly send Ether to the contract: You could also become the owner by directly sending Ether to the contract's address, assuming you have contributed before. Remember that sending ETH directly to a contract consumes more gas than calling a function.

Remember, for every Ethereum transaction (sending Ether, calling functions in a contract), you have to pay a gas fee. So, you need to have enough Ether in your account not just to contribute to the contract, but also to pay for gas fees.

It's also worth mentioning that the exact amount of Ether you need to become the largest contributor and hence the owner, depends on the state of the contract (specifically, how much the current owner and other addresses have contributed). You might need to interact with the getContribution() function to figure out the current largest contribution.

Finally, always be cautious when interacting with contracts and only interact with contracts that you trust or understand as transactions on the Ethereum network are irreversible.

How do I withdraw all the ether after that?

Once you have become the owner of the contract, you can call the withdraw() function to withdraw all Ether (ETH) that is currently in the contract. The withdraw() function is protected by the onlyOwner modifier, which means only the current owner of the contract can execute this function.

The steps to withdraw all Ether from the contract as the owner are:

    Open your Ethereum client: This could be Metamask, MyEtherWallet, or any other client that you use to interact with Ethereum contracts.

    Call the withdraw function: The interface to do this will depend on your client. Generally, you will need to enter the contract's address and the ABI (Application Binary Interface), select the withdraw() function, and then submit the transaction.

    Confirm and pay for the transaction: After you have set up the transaction, you need to confirm it and pay for the gas fees. The gas fees are used to pay the Ethereum miners for including your transaction in the blockchain. You will need to have enough ETH in your account to pay for these fees.

    Wait for transaction to be mined: Once you have submitted and paid for the transaction, you need to wait for it to be included in the blockchain. Once the transaction has been included, the Ether from the contract will be transferred to your account.

Remember, transactions on the Ethereum network are irreversible. Once you've executed the withdraw() function, you can't undo this. So ensure that you're confident in your actions before you confirm any transaction.

Lastly, make sure you trust the contract you're interacting with, as smart contracts can sometimes have bugs or malicious code. If the contract was not coded properly, there could be risks involved, such as the loss of your funds.
